This                             physical distance has become more troublesome than I thought. No matter where I go, I can catch a glimpse of you. They make me want to be close to you again.I love you for life. I cherish and appreciate every second we spend together, and when we are apart, I ache to be inside your heart. I can feel you close to me even though you‚Äôre far away. This evening, when I wrote this letter, it was like you were by my side. I feel your hands on my shoulders, your fingers on my hair, and the delicate breath of your kisses on my cheeks. Honey, I miss you. I love you so much that it is difficult for me to spend these days without you.",
